Given A, can we prove that for some P (0 < P < A^2), ((A+1)^n + (A-1)^n)%(A^2) will never be equal to P?

Yes, we can prove that for a given A > 1, there exist values of P (0 < P < A^2) for which the expression ((A+1)^n + (A-1)^n) % A^2 will never be equal to P for any positive integer n.

### Analyzing the Expression

Let's use the **binomial theorem** to expand the expression.
(A+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} A^k = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}A + \binom{n}{2}A^2 + \binom{n}{3}A^3 + \dots
(A-1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} A^k (-1)^{n-k} = \binom{n}{0}(-1)^n + \binom{n}{1}A(-1)^{n-1} + \binom{n}{2}A^2(-1)^{n-2} + \binom{n}{3}A^3(-1)^{n-3} + \dots

Now, let's add the two expansions together. The terms with odd powers of A will cancel if n is even, and will add if n is odd. The terms with even powers of A will always add.

When we consider the expression modulo A^2, all terms containing A^2 or higher powers of A will become zero.
( (A+1)^n + (A-1)^n ) \pmod{A^2} = \left( \left(\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}A\right) + \left(\binom{n}{0}(-1)^n + \binom{n}{1}A(-1)^{n-1}\right) \right) \pmod{A^2}

This simplifies to two main cases based on the parity of n.

### Case 1: n is even (n=2k for some integer k \ge 1)

If n is even, then (-1)^n = 1 and (-1)^{n-1} = -1. The expression becomes:
\left( (1+nA) + (1-nA) \right) \pmod{A^2} = (2) \pmod{A^2} = 2
So, for any even value of n, the expression is always equal to **2**.

### Case 2: n is odd (n=2k+1 for some integer k \ge 0)

If n is odd, then (-1)^n = -1 and (-1)^{n-1} = 1. The expression becomes:
\left( (1+nA) + (-1+nA) \right) \pmod{A^2} = (2nA) \pmod{A^2}
Since A>1, 2nA will be a multiple of A. The possible values of 2nA \pmod{A^2} are 0, 2A, 4A, 6A, \dots, (A-2)A. All these values are multiples of 2A. For example, if A=5, the values are multiples of 10. If A=6, the values are multiples of 12.

### Conclusion

The expression ((A+1)^n + (A-1)^n) \pmod{A^2} can only produce a very limited set of values.
* If n is even, the result is always **2**.
* If n is odd, the result is always an even multiple of A.

This means the value of the expression can only belong to the set \{2, 2A, 4A, 6A, \dots, \text{some multiple of } A\}.

Therefore, for any given A > 1, we can choose a value for P that is not in this set. For instance, we could choose **P = 1**. Since A>1, 1 is not equal to 2 or any multiple of A. Another example would be P=3. As long as A>1, 3 is not equal to 2 or any multiple of A (unless A=3 and 2A is a possibility, but 3 is not in the set of possible values for A=3 either).

Thus, we have proven that there are values of P that the expression will **never** equal.
